For the first reference, big data is defined by using the three V's, volume, variety, and velocity. What is meant by this is that there must be a large amount of data that comes in several different formats and changes/is added to constantly. It is not clear whether or not the data is neccesarily scientific or not but it does appear that the use of it will answer questions.

The second link basically tells the same story with big data. It defines it as high-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety, the same three things stated within the first link. Again, this source does not state whether it has to be scinetific or not but that it does help to answer questions and make decisions.

The third link is from Forbes and tells the history of data. In November of 2000, the article defines big data as "the explosion in the quantity (and sometimes, quality) of available and potentially relevant data, largely the result of recent and unprecedented advancements in data recording and storage technology." This seems to go along with the other two sources but does not define if a question a must be answered with the data or not.

All three sources are consistent in what big data means since they all state that it must be a large volume of continuously added to data. None of them define that it must be scientific but the last does differ in that it never tells if a question must be answered by the data.

# So is your implicit definition "a large volume of continuously add to data?"
