Score: 90/100

Although a significant amount of work went into this, the project was a bit mis-scoped.  Although the difficulty level was high, the lack of a final result prevents the score from being any higher.

I can see the work done here as being very useful to the lab, and I encourage you to better document it so that someone else could pick it up and build on it.  To do this, you'll need carefully crafted examples of use and notes.
