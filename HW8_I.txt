For my project, the data that is stored is placed into several tables. The first of which is titled Harvest Data 
and contains all of the information about a given harvest such as who did the harvest, what type of particle was used, 
how much of the particle, what type of serum, how much serum, etc.

The secondary tables are those with the data about what was returned from the mass spectrometry analysis. These are 
linked to their specific harvest by ID and also by table name (Harvest _ Peptide Data). Each of these tables contains 
all of the peptide sequences found and the data about that specific sequence (i.e. molecular weight, isoelectric point, 
hydrophobicity, etc.).

Although not currently entered yet, a third set of tables will be used for the data about the peptide sequence, This 
includes EC-50 rates for different bactria and a link to any files that are associated to it. These tables wil be 
linked to the Harvest _ Peptide Data tables through sequence.

Although not linked to any other tables, there is one that contains the information about those who are authorized to 
access the database and/or alter it. Each person will have to log in and all changes that are made by them will be logged 
in an additional tables linked to their ID.

# OK, but a diagram would have helped here.
